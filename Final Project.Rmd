## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
# Load dataset
load("36423-0002-Data.rda")

# Select subset of data with variables of interest
subdata = subset(da36423.0002, select = c(S3FIELD_STEM, X2CONTROL, X2LOCALE, X2REGION, X3TGPASTEM, X2TXMTSCOR, X2SCIID, X2SCIEFF, X2MTHID, X2MTHEFF))

subdata = na.omit(subdata)

attach(subdata)

# First model with Region, School Type, and Locale controls
# Outcome variable is binary coding of STEM Major considerations (Considering STEM major = 1; Not considering STEM major = 0)

mod1 = glm(S3FIELD_STEM ~ X2CONTROL + X2LOCALE + X2REGION, family = "binomial")
summary(mod1)

# Second model with Cumulative GPA for STEM courses, Math Achievement

mod2 = glm(S3FIELD_STEM ~ X2CONTROL + X2LOCALE + X2REGION + X3TGPASTEM + X2TXMTSCOR, family = "binomial")
summary(mod2)

# Third model with Science and Math identity and self-efficacy beliefs. Both are standardized.

mod3 = glm(S3FIELD_STEM ~ X2CONTROL + X2LOCALE + X2REGION + X3TGPASTEM + X2TXMTSCOR + X2SCIID + X2SCIEFF + X2MTHID + X2MTHEFF , family = "binomial")
summary(mod3)

# Fourth model with Locale as an interaction term

mod4 = glm(S3FIELD_STEM ~ (X2CONTROL + X2REGION + X3TGPASTEM + X2TXMTSCOR + X2SCIID + X2SCIEFF + X2MTHID + X2MTHEFF) * X2LOCALE , family = "binomial")
summary(mod4)

# Hosmer-Lemeshower Test for Model Fit

HL = generalhoslem::logitgof(obs = S3FIELD_STEM, exp = fitted(mod4), g = 10)
HL

# Calculating McFadden's Pseudo-R-Squared

mod0 = glm(S3FIELD_STEM ~ 1, family = "binomial")

R2_0 = 1 - (mod3$deviance/mod0$deviance)
R2_2 = 1 - (mod4$deviance/mod3$deviance)

R2_0
R2_2

# Likelihood Ration Test

lmtest::lrtest(mod3, mod4)

# Looking at the Confidence Intervals
exp(cbind(OR = coef(mod4), confint(mod4)))

# Creating the Stargazer output table that shows progression in model building
stargazer::stargazer(mod1, mod2, mod3, mod4, type = "text", omit = "Constant")

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
